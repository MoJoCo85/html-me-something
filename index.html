    <p> I was born and raised in Thomasville, Georgia on October 3, 1985. 
        There, I grew up playing multiple sports and quickly develeped a passion
        for athletics. I mainly ran track, wrestled, and played football.

    <p> My success in athletics landed me in Williamsburg, Kentucky at The 
        University of the Cumberlands. There I continued to excel in sports, earned 
        my B.S. in Exercise Science, and eventually met my wife. Life after college happend
        and my wife and I bore our first born child, Micah. Tragedy struck, and we moved back 
        to Georgia for a short time before my wife decided to finish her degree.

    <p> My wife's old coach from The University of the Cumberlands was now the head 
        coach at Lindenwood University in Missouri so she decided to go there. I followed 
        shortly after in October of 2011. We settled down, found a church, grew our roots
        and we've been here every since!  </p> &nbsp;
